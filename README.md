This repo contains two machine learning algorithms
1. polynomial regression
2. Classification with Scikit Learn Library

## Classification with Scikit Learn Library
This will cover classification problem by using Scikit Learn Library

     import sklearn.linear_model
     import sklearn.tree
     import sklearn.ensemble
     import sklearn.model_selection
     import sklearn.metrics
     import numpy as np

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
     %matplotlib inline
     
 This is Scikit Learn Library to solve our classification problem
